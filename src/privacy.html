            <h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
            <p>Like many sites, we use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Site. This Section refers to information that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual.</p>
            <p>We gather certain information about the use of our Website by our visitors. This information is then compiled and analyzed in a way that does not identify our visitors personally. The information may include the referring Uniform Resource Locator (URL), indicating from where a visitor to our Website has come, which URLs have been visited on our Website and in what order, what browser is being used, and what Internet Protocol (IP) address a visitor used to get to our Website. We may also use such information for Website and system administration.</p>
            <h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
            <p>This site may contain links or references to other Web sites. Please be aware that we do not control other Web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every Web site you visit.</p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>We take reasonable steps using physical, electronic or procedural security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in our custody or control, which may include safeguards to protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, use, copying, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free.  In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.</p>
            <h4>Updates</h4>
            <p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page, and update the Privacy Policy modification date above.  We will not materially change this Privacy Policy in a way that makes it less protective of the personal information we have previously collected from you without notice to you.</p>
